### 7. What are the alternatives to Google?

Google is a globally recognized search engine and an industry giant. But even if it’s the biggest and most well-known, it doesn’t mean it’s your only choice. One of the main reasons that people choose to use an alternative search engine instead is for increased privacy, as Google is known to track user data both for its own and thirdparty use.

#### Bing

Microsoft’s Bing has become an alternative search engine option for many people today. It’s easy to use and provides beautiful background photos. Just like Google, Bing is full of **internal features** like currency conversion, translation, and flight
tracking, making it a really **versatile tool** that holds its niche in the global market. 19 While you’re likely familiar with Bing, you might not know that it offers a Rewards scheme. When you shop or search through Bing, you earn points that can be put towards purchasing apps and movies, which is **pretty handy**. Bing has recently been trying to **catch up** with Google in the advertising space, adding a number of features to Bing Ads. While Bing doesn’t have the market share that Google does, it is still popular in many markets including the U.S. and the U.K.

#### Baidu

Baidu **was founded in** in 2000 and is the dominant search engine in China with a market share of over 70 percent. Although in Mandarin, it is strikingly **similar to** Google in terms of design. However, Baidu is heavily **censored**. Certain images and even pro-democracy websites are blocked on the search engine. Outside of China, Baidu holds little influence. But within the country, Baidu powers 3.3 billion searches **per day**. The **downside** to Baidu is that it only gives access to one market. The upside is that the market it gives access to is huge. That said, it’s crucial for businesses to understand that accessing the Chinese market is not like accessing any other. The visuals, verbiage and customs are entirely different and Google Translate isn’t going to help you win any customers over. To access the Chinese market via Baidu, you need someone on staff who speaks the language and understands the culture.

#### Yandex

Yandex is used extensively in its native Russia, where it **holds** around 60% of the search engine market share. It provides a very similar service to Google, and you can search websites, images, videos, and news in a **user-friendly** layout. It also has additional features including mobile apps, maps, translation, cloud storage and more. Yandex has its roots in a project started by two Russian developers to aid in the classification of patents in 1990. The term Yandex **was adopted** in 1993 standing for “Yet Another iNDEXer.” The Yandex.ru domain was launched in 1997. In 2011, they **went public** on the New York Stock Exchange with an IPO (initial public 20 offering) of $1.3 billion making it the second largest at the time (right after Google). Yandex currently powers more than half of all searches in Russia.

#### Ecosia

Heavy search engine usage has a considerable impact on CO2 emissions. That is where Ecosia comes in: the CO2 neutral alternative search engine. Their servers run on 100% **renewable energy** and they use their profit to plant trees. About 80% of their ads revenue goes **towards** the tree-planting scheme. **On average**, roughly 45 searches are needed to plant a single tree.

#### Search Encrypt

Search Encrypt is a privacy-based search engine, which uses **encryption** to ensure that users’ identifiable information cannot **be tracked**. As a metasearch engine, Search Encrypt gets its results from a network of search partners, providing well-rounded results that aren’t personalized to your history. A really interesting feature of this search engine is that it automatically **erases** your local browsing history after 15 minutes of inactivity. This means that you never have to worry about your privacy, even if someone else has access to your computer.
