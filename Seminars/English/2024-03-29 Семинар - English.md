## Infinitive and gerund

### The Gerund

$$\text{V+ing}$$

> [!note] The gerund can be used:
> 1) ***as a noun*** (Smuggling is illegal.);
> 2) ***after likes or dislikes*** *(love, hate, prefer, enjoy, loath, detest, bear)* (I like swimming. **BUT** I would like to swim.);
> 3) ***verbs with prepositions*** *(think of, give up, keen on)* (I am thinking of going to Italy.);
> 4) ***go* + activity** *(go shopping, go jogging, go swimming, etc.)*;
> 5) after certain verbs *(consider, avoid, deny, look forward to, confess to, fancy, involve, mention, risk, spend, mind, regret, admit, suggest, imagine, to be worth, etc.)*

### The Infinitive

> [!note] The bare infinitive is used:
> 1) after modal verbs (*can, may, should, etc.*);
> 2) after the verbs *let, make, see, hear, feel* **IN ACTIVE VOICE** (They made him *pay* for the damage of the company. **BUT** He was made to pay for the damage.)
> 3) after *had better* and *would rather* (I would rather refuse.)

### The forms of the Infinitive

|                   | Active                   | Passive              |

| Continuous        | to be + $V_{ing}$        | -                    |
| Perfect           | to have + $V_3$          | to have been + $V_3$ |
| Perfect Continuos | to have been + $V_{ing}$ | -                    |

> [!note]
> *advise, allow, forbid, permit, recommend* are followed by the gerund, but if there is an object we use the to infinitive.
